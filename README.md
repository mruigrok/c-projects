# shearsort

# filters
Implemented a [Savizky-Golay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter) filter to smooth noisy input signals.

# dir traversal
Designed to be similar to the -ls lRa command. Also displays file/dir/link inode propeties

# battleship
Found an old Battleship Game I programmed using C to run on the command line. 
Has some obvious beginner-looking code (large functions, strange loop iterations) in it but it was my first real project while learning the language.

# learning
Implemented value iteration and q learning to play count to 20 game
